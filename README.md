This is a photo-taggin app - a game in the vein of Where's Waldo. The Odin Project requires it as the final project of the JavaScript course. It was created using React, plus Google's backend-as-a-service, Firebase. 

In all honesty it is probably not the finest example of React code. I struggle to say more about what I got out of this project - ultimately I just built it piece by piece, googling frequently when I needed help figuring out how to do something. Looking at my code some time after the fact, I wonder if I could have done a better job not cramming everything into the App.js file, and instead making better use of the components. 

(I will expand this readme later, particularly after I go through ReactJS a second time and get a better understanding of how to use the technology)
